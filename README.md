This repository is created while following the Abhishek Thakur's youtube videos ([video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqgj-Udcqs&t=51s) and [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArygUBY0QXw)).The dataset used is from the Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cat-in-the-dat) and is mainly categorical.

Using label encoding and GradientBoostClassifier with 500 estimators, I got public and private leaderboard scores of 0.77.

Thanks to Abhishek Thakur.
