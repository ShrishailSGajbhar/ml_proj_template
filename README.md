# ml_proj_template
ML project template created while following the Abhishek Thakur's youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqgj-Udcqs&t=51s).
The dataset used is from the Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cat-in-the-dat) and is mainly categorical.
I used the GradientBoostClassifier with 500 estimators which provided public and private leaderboard scores of 0.77 with a simple approach.

Thanks to Abhishek Thakur.
